1. Description - Minimum  250 word description of the proposed project.
    * We will be producing a web extension that provides a spoiler filter for all specified topics by the user. This system to block spoilers will blur out any text on a web page determined to be a spoiler for the given topics provided. After the text has been blurred the user can unblur the text by clicking the blurred area of text which will then reveal the previously blurred spoiler. This will be implemented using JavaScript by editing the HTML tags prior to loading a page. While any given page is being loaded by the user the extension will take all text into account and appropriately blur things prior to load to ensure that no spoilers are visible on the screen unless explicitly specified by the user later on. The aim of this project is to provide any user with the ability to prevent popular media that they enjoy from being ruined by news articles, people that have already seen the media, and internet trolls. The implementation for the blocker will make use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to edit the web pages and Python, Java, and SQL to identify spoilers inside of text. The extension will be built for Google Chrome using their web extension/app development system and directions. The end product of this project will be a downloadable web extension available on the Google Chrome store that can be acquired by any Chrome user and will be able to prevent the user from seeing any unwanted spoilers.
2. Division of Work - Outlines how the work is envisaged to be split equally among the team members.
    * We have agreed on a paired programming approach but when appropriate will work separately on our own areas to finish the project in a timely and appropriate manor.
3. Programming language(s) - List the proposed language(s) to be used
    * HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, maybe Java and SQL
4. Programming tool(s) - List tools (compiler, database, web server, etc.) to be used
    * Sublime
    * Terminal
    * Eclipse
    * MySQL
    * Chrome extension guidelines and directions for web extension/app development
5. Learning Challenges - List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn
    * Learning JavaScript
    * Finding appropriate ways to implement spoiler search
    * Making an efficient system for detecting and censoring
6. Hardware / software platform - State the hardware and software platform for development, eg. PC, Linux, etc.
    * PC/Mac and Windows/Linux
7. Special hardware / software requirements - Describe any special requirements.
    * None
